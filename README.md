# utilc-math

## Introduction
_This section of the README file introduces the library to developers._

`utilc-math` contains templates for creating a new `utilc` library.
All `utilc` projects try to keep to this template wherever possible.


## Purpose
_Describe why this library is useful to the developer. What problems does this library solve?_

This template saves the hassle of manually creating all the files that form a `utilc` library.

## Code Example
_Provide a code example showing the library API, try to keep the code nice and condensed.
Don't bother with error checking, include comments if necessary.
Provide a link to the example file, as shown below._

A full example, making use of the full `utilc-math` API is available in [example](https://github.com/camieac/utilc-math/blob/master/example/utilc-math-example.c). A shortened example is given below:
```
uc_template_h template;
uc_template_create(template)
```

## Installation
_Provide basic installation instructions, whilst also linking to more detailed installation instructions._

This project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) to build, test, and install `utic-timing`. Installation instructions are contained within [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/camieac/utilc-math/blob/master/INSTALL.md), and summarised below:
